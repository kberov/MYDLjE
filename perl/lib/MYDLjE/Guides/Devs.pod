MYDLjE::Guides::Devs - know how to contribute code to MYDLjE

=head1 INTRO


MYDLjE is a suite of three L<Mojolicious>-based applications that 
share code with each other and work together well. 
So I<everything> you know so far about L<Mojolicious> applies. 
As template system we use L<Template::Alloy::TT> because it is faster 
and lighter than Template Toolkit itself and has very convenient 
L<TT3|http://tt3.template-toolkit.org/> features. 
Browse the source to see  what Perl modules are bundled with the distribution.
These are only pure-Perl Modules to ensure an easy cross-platform installation.

If you are not sure what We are talking about, go to L<Mojolicious::Guides> 
and then come back.

You are back? Great! Now we can get to the point.

L<MOJO_HOME|Mojolicious::Guides::Cheatsheet/MOJO_HOME> is the root directory for your L<MYDLjE>-based system. It is auto-discovered when an application starts. 
The three applications C<cpanel>, C<mydlje> and C<site> reside in C<MOJO_HOME>. 
This is possible thanks to the L<Mojolicious> flexibility.

In the C<conf> directory are the configuration files. They are in YAML format. By default L<YAML::Tiny> is used for parsing, but if you have L<YAML> installed it will be used instead.
See L<YAML::Any> for details.  See L<MYDLjE::Config> for details on how it works. 

In C<conf> you will also find C<mysql.schema.sql>, C<mysql.data.sql> and C<mysql.queries.sql>.
The first is used to initialize the database(create tables add constraints) during L<MYDLjE> installation. The second is parsed and statements in it are executed just after the first. The last file contains commonly used queries and part of queries (C<WHERE> clauses). 
You can add your own queries there.

Note that these C<*.sql> files are well-formed and valid xml files. It turned out to be very convenient to use L<Mojo::DOM> to parse them and in the same time keep most text editors syntax highliting happy.

  -- <query name="write_permissions_sql" params="user_id,user_id"><![CDATA[
    
    (
      (user_id = ? AND permissions LIKE '_rw%')
      OR ( group_id IN (SELECT group_id FROM user_group WHERE user_id= ?) 
        AND permissions LIKE '____rw%')
    )
  
  -- ]]></query>

The C<log> folder is for the log files. Note that some early warnings or errors may be logged to the Apache log. 
    #Example:
    cd ~/opt/public_dev/MYDLjE/; tail -n200 -f log/development.log

In C<perl/bin> we keep utility commandline scripts. Everything from Mojo scripts folder is also there. In L<perl/lib> are all the Perl Modules that come bundled with L<MYDLjE>. C<perl/site/bin> and C<perl/site/lib> are intended for your custom, application specific code. These folders will not be ever touched if you upgrade MYDLjE.

=head1 APPLICATIONS

As you already know from the L<README>, there are three applications that compose the 
MYDLjE Application and Content Management Framework. These are
L<MYDLjE>, L<MYDLjE::ControlPanel> and L<MYDLjE::Site>. 
C<cpanel>, C<mydlje> and C<site> are simply startup scripts.

=head2 MYDLjE

TODO...

See API documentation for L<MYDLjE>!

=head2 MYDLjE::ControlPanel

TODO...

See API documentation for L<MYDLjE::ControlPanel>!

=head2 MYDLjE::Site

MYDLjE::Site works the same way as MYDLjE::ControlPanel does.

Its main purpose is to display pages and content 
stored in the databse by L<MYDLjE::ControlPanel>.
Here is how a page gets displayed in the browser 
after a user clicks on some link.

=head3 Page request flow

TODO: implement it

=over

The user is restored from L<msession|MYDLjE::C/msession>
or a new msession is instantiated and an L<MYDLjE::M::User> instance is put in it.

MYDLjE::Site differentiates  between content language and user interface language. 
A user could browse English content while having messages in Bulgarian.
Current content language is restored from C<$c-E<gt>session('c_language')> or 
C<$c-E<gt>req-E<gt>param('c_language')> is used. 
C<$c-E<gt>req-E<gt>param('c_language')> takes precedence if both are defined. 
If none of them is available, language is detected from the browser and 
is used if supported by the system. Finally the system fallbacks to the 
default language defined in mydlje-site configuration 
file (eg. mydlje-site.development.yaml) or its parent configuration 
(mydlje.development.yaml). 

The language switching and detection for the messages works the same way 
but C<$c-E<gt>session('ui_language')> or 
C<$c-E<gt>req-E<gt>param('ui_language')> is used.

The current domain is detected from C<$ENV{HTTP_HOST}> 
(C<$c-E<gt>req-E<gt>headers-E<gt>host>).

The page is retrieved from table C<pages> by alias and page properties are 
retrieved from table C<content> by data_type (C<page>) and 
page_id (C<$page-E<gt>page_id>). 
The passed alias is taken from C<$c-E<gt>stash('page_alias')>. 
It is put there by Mojolicious. 

If the page has its own template it will be used to render the page. 
Otherwise the table is searched recursively for a parent page (C<pid>) 
with defined template.
If no parent page with template is found the C<default> page 
(usually named "home") template is used.
The page template specifies the template wrapper (C<TEMPLATE_WRAPPER>), 
which is the layout for the page to be used. Defaults to 
C<site/layouts/default.html.tt>.

The page content is retrieved from table C<content> by C<page_id> and C<language>.

The content with C<data_type> "brick" is retrieved recursively 
from current and then parent and C<default> pages like the C<page> template.

C<permissions> field is used to filter the page and its content.
C<published> and other fields are taken into account too 
(see the L<MYDLjE::Site::C::Site> and mysql.queries.sql source).

After all needed data is retrieved it is put in the stash 
(C<$c-E<gt>stash()>) and the page is rendered. 

In the template further processing is made by L<MYDLjE::Template::PageContent>.

=head1 PLUGINS

=head2 MYDLjE/Mojolicious Plugins

=head2 Template Plugins

MYDLjE implements a L<base|MYDLjE::Template> L<Template::Plugin> 
class from which you can inherit
to write your own plugins intended for embedding in templates 
of a MYDLjE based Site. It does not inherit from L<Template::Plugin> but 
follow the API and recomendations specified 
by L<Andy Wardley|https://metacpan.org/author/ABW>.

At the time of writing there are two L<MYDLjE::Template> plugis that you can
use as reference implementations for your own plugins 
or just inherit from then to build some more specific plugin.

These are: L<MYDLjE::Template::PageContent> 
(used in C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/templates/site/site/page.html.tt>),
L<MYDLjE::Template::PageTree> 
(used in C<$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/templates/cpanel/site/pages.html.tt>) 

=head1 Your own MYDLjE and Mojolicious Applications


You can write your own custom applications which do not use MYDLjE code at all, 
but are based on Mojolicious only. In its turn Mojolicious allows you to 
use only what you want from it. 
You can also write front-end applications similar to L<site> and use the MYDLjE 
framework, database etc. You can also write embedded "applications" 
which run in the site application or even embedded in a L<site> page. 
How you will approach depends completely on you. 

As you see we use the term "application" pretty deliberatly 
and we mean by it I<something which is logically complete>.
The imaginary I<shop> application may be implemented as a controller class 
(MYDLjE::Site::C::Shop) with its own actions. 
A I<forum> application may be represented by a page record in which a 
L<MYDLjE::Template> plugin is called and its all business logic happens there 
(in one page of your site).

Finally... this is Perl. However some recommended approaches are described below.
